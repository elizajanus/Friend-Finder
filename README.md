# Friend-Finder

##Navigate to the Survey page

##Submit your responses to the survey as well as your identifying information (name, photo url)

##Friend-Finder will search storage to find the friend whose answers are closest to yours, aka your new best friend

##A modal appears with the name and picture of your new best friend

##BUGS: sometimes when Submit is clicked, server-side function runs but dynamic jquery does not. If Submit is clicked twice, it adds the newFriend twice
